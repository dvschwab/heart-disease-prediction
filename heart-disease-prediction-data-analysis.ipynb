    "\n",
    "Here are summaries of the accuracy and classification performance for each of the three models. The accuracy is how often the model correctly predicted the target, while the classification report provides more detail on whether the model overpredicts the target (precision) or underpredicts (recall). For each model, the accuracy and negative mean squared error (MSE) from a 5-fold cross validation are also reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the three models behave much the same: the greatest difference in accuracy scores across all models is between the train and test data for the *clf_reduced* model (0.86 and 0.82, respectively). The classification scores are also similar for both targets( *no disease* and *disease*), showing a slight tendency to better predict the presence of disease than its absence: the greatest difference here is for the *clf_trimmed* model, with an f1 score of 0.86 for the target *no disease* and 0.79 for the target *disease*. None of the three models show significant differences between precision and recall for either target. The 7% difference between the targets for the *clf_trimmed* model may be due to the removal of 20 outliers (7% of the total); this model also uses the reduced feature set containing 10 features rather than 14 for the *clf_all* model: depending on which features were more likely to contain outliers, this may also contribute to the observed difference. Further investigation of the outliers may confirm or reject this hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-validation scores show that all three models have a degree of sample dependency: the differences between the highest and lowest accuracy scores are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* clf_all:          (0.83, 0.92)\n",
    "* clf_reduced:      (0.75, 0.90)\n",
    "* clf_trimmed:      (0.76, 0.89)\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the MSE of each model are of similar magnitude and are correlated with their respective accuracy scores for all three models. More investigation is needed before any of these models is considered ready for production use. One avenue would be to re-run the cross-validations without prior shuffling: this would place the same cases in each fold for all three models, and observed similarities or differences here might highlight the portion of the overall data set that is sample dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility for the differences is the relatively low number of cases for each fold: the *clf_all* and *clf_reduced* have 58 cases per fold, which are estimated for 13 features (*clf_all*) or 9 features (*clf_reduced*). The guideline for regression models is between 10 - 15 cases per feature: neither model comes close to meeting this criterion. Since the *clf_trimmed* model has both the reduced set of features and 20 fewer cases, the result is even more pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possibilities that may improve the reliability of the cross-validation estimates: the most straightforward is to use fewer folds, with 4 folds still keeping within the recommended guidelines for cross-validation and 3 folds at least approaching the guidelines for regression, yielding a fold-size of 90 for the *clf_all* and *clf_reduced* models and a size of 71 for the *clf_trimmed* model. This gives 7, 10, and 8 cases per feature, respectively (using standard rounding); an improvement, although still not meeting the guidelines. The reliability of the cross-validation would also, of course, be reduced. Excluding more features from each model would further improve these numbers, although there are no features in the reduced model that are obvious candidates. Employing another validation strategy, such as leave-one-out validation, might also be a solution, although again at the expense of model reliability. If none of these methods are justified given the data, one mitigation would be to bootstrap confidence intervals for each cross-validation; although these would necessarily be quite wide, they at least would provide criteria against which to measure the relative dependence of each model on the data sample. Clearly, further analysis is needed on this limitation."

    "\n",
    "As noted above, one advantage logistic regression has against other classification algorithms is the relative explanatory power of the model coefficients. These are listed below for all 3 models, with the feature names identifying the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the coefficients for each feature are consistent in both sign and magnitude across all models: the largest single difference is between the *flouroscopy* coefficients for the *clf_all* and *clf_reduced* models and the *clf_trimmed* model, with the former two very similar at 2.04 and 1.89, respectively, and the latter estimated as 1.39: a difference of at least 0.50. Using standardized feature values would reveal the true importance of this difference. The coefficients for *angina* show a similar, although less pronounced difference of 0.71, 0.76, and 0.45 respectively. These differences, however, only impact 2 out of the 10 features common to all 3 models; the overall strong agreement between the remaining 8 features is a clear indication that the choice of model is robust to the differences between the number of feature and the removal of outliers with respect to coefficient estimation. Computing p-values through bootstrapping would likely provide further evidence of this hypothesis given the expected large values of the standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of explanatory power, all 3 models assign relatively greater importance to the features *sex* (averaging 1.01), *chest_pain* (-1.15), *flouroscopy* (1.77), and *heart_defect* (1.44); it is interesting, although perhaps coincidence that these features are all binary. Of these, the negative magnitude for *chest_pain* is counterintuitive, although several commenters on Kaggle familiar with the data set have reproduced this finding among several different models and procedures. Of the continuous features, neither *age* or *max_heart_rate* show much importance despite their clear relationship to the target demonstrated in their respective boxplots; this may be due to the moderate correlation (-0.40) between the features and, in addition, the relatively wide range of values they each exhibit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient for the remaining continous feature, *oldpeak*, averages 0.52 across the 3 models, albeit with a much smaller value range (SHOW HERE). According to the feature description, this represents the decrease in the ST node observed by exercise relative to rest. It remains for a medical professional to determine whether this finding is actually of diagnostic interest. Of the features excluded from the two reduced models, only the presence of a fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl is perhaps important; again, this would require validation from a medical professional.\n"

    "\n",
    "The data set analyzed had 14 predictors of heart disease and 296 cases. The target was the presence of heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes). Three logistic regression models were fit: (1) the full data set; (2) a reduced data set with only the 10 strongest predictors, as identifed by prior analysis; and (3) a reduced data set where 20 outliers (approx. 7% of the total) were trimmed. Each model was trained with 70% of the total cases and then tested on the remaining 30%. The results described here are from that experiment. Five-fold cross-validation was also used to determine the sensitivity of the model to the data set. A classification report listing the precision, recall, and f1 score was also generated for each of the three models.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three models are a good fit to the data, with mean accuracy scores of 0.85, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively (testing data). The classification reports did not identiy any significant trend to overpredict or underpredict the target, although all three models were better at prediction the presence of no disease than the presence of heart disease (the trimmed model shows the greatest difference of 0.86 (no disease) and 0.79 (heart disease)). In addition, the coefficients for 8 out of the 10 features included in all three models did not substantially differ in both sign and magnitude. This suggests that logistic regression is a suitable choice for this data set and that it is relatively robust to both the exclusion of features and the exclusion of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, all three models show clear evidence of sample dependence, as indicated by the cross-validation scores. The full model performs the best, but even here there is a difference of 0.09 (cv scores 0.92 and 0.83). Both of the remaining models have differences over 0.10. As noted in the discussion, this is exacerbated by the small size of the folds given the relatively large number of features: adding confidence intervals to these scores may show that they are not statistically significant, but the intervals would likely be wide enough that the true extent of the issue (if any) would remain unknown. It was suggested that a further cross-validation might be performed using either 4 or 3 folds, thereby trading some reliability for more validity. Excluding additional features, perhaps through a stepwise approach, remains another option, although not a desirable one. It may also be possible to combine similar features, either through grouping classes or feature engineering. If this approach is considered, the new features must be thoroughly validated by someone with proper medical credentials before their contribution may be considered."
