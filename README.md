# heart-disease-prediction (dev)

This is the development branch of the heart disease prediction logistic regression model. It contains additional code to estimate the probability of heart disease given certain feature values. The goal is to identify cases of interest and then compare their probabilities of disease both directly and through hazard rates.

The additional code isn't ready for deployment, although you can examine it to see the logic. I hope to update and complete it soon, but don't have a definite timeline for that yet.
